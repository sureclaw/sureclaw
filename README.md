---

AX is a **personal AI agent** that lets you message an AI assistant (via CLI, Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.) and have it take actions on your behalf — read emails, fetch web pages, control a browser, manage your calendar, remember your preferences.

Sound familiar? It should. **OpenClaw** proved that AI agents can be genuinely useful. The problem is that OpenClaw also proved what happens when you don't think about security until it's too late: ~173k lines of code nobody can audit, 42,665 exposed instances on Shodan, a remote code execution CVE, and 341 malicious skills in its marketplace.

We love what OpenClaw does. We just couldn't sleep at night running it.

AX gives you the same power — **multi-channel messaging, web access, browser automation, long-term memory, extensible skills** — but with security guardrails that are actually enforced by the architecture, not just by good intentions. And at ~4,150 lines of code, it's small enough to audit in a day.

The best part? **You decide where you sit on the spectrum.** Lock everything down, open everything up, or land somewhere in the middle. We give you the dial. We just make sure the safety net is always there, even when you crank it to 11.

## Architecture

We use a **provider contract pattern** — every subsystem (LLM, memory, scanner, channels, etc.) is a TypeScript interface with pluggable implementations. The host process is trusted. Agent containers are not. That's not rude, it's just good security.

### Trust Zones

| Zone | Trust Level | Isolation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Host Process** | Fully trusted | Runs on your machine |
| **Agent Container** | Untrusted | No network, no credentials, no host filesystem |
| **Browser Container** | Untrusted | Filtered egress only |

### Architectural Invariants

A few things are non-negotiable regardless of which profile you choose. These are **enforced by the architecture** and can't be weakened by configuration:

- Agent containers have **no network access**. All external communication goes through the host's IPC proxy.
- Credentials **never** enter containers. API keys are injected server-side. The agent can use them, but it can never see them.
- All external content is **taint-tagged**. Emails, web pages, anything from outside gets labeled and tracked.
- Every action is **audited**. Containers cannot modify the audit log.
- The agent **cannot modify its own sandbox**.
- **No web UI**. OpenClaw's dashboard was its #1 attack vector, so we solved that problem by not having one.

### Sandbox Tiers

| Platform | Default | Escalation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Linux | nsjail (~5ms start) | Docker + gVisor |
| macOS | Seatbelt (sandbox-exec) | Docker Desktop |

We start with the lightest sandbox that does the job. If the agent needs heavier tools, we escalate mid-session. Most invocations never need more than nsjail — it starts in 5 milliseconds and uses about 1MB of memory.

## Security Profiles

This is the dial. You pick where you want to be:

| Profile | What it's for | Taint Threshold |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Paranoid** (default) | Maximum safety. Web disabled, no OAuth, read-only skills. | 10% |
| **Standard** | The sweet spot for most people. Web access with blocklists, scheduled tasks, skill proposals with review. | 30% |
| **Power User** | Full capability. Unrestricted web, read-write OAuth, browser automation, multi-agent delegation. You know the risks. | 60% |

The taint threshold controls when we pause to ask before doing something sensitive (like sending an email) based on how much external content is in the conversation. Higher threshold = more autonomy. All three profiles keep the architectural invariants intact — the agent never gets network access or raw credentials, no matter what.

We default to Paranoid not because we think you need it, but because we think defaults should be safe. Upgrading to Standard or Power User is one line in `ax.yaml`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set your API key (don't worry, it never enters the sandbox)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Run AX
npm start

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Configuration

Edit `ax.yaml` to configure providers, security profile, and sandbox settings. The defaults are conservative — we'd rather you opt into power than accidentally leave the door open. But opting in is easy, and we won't judge.

## Contributing

We'd love your help. Before diving in, please read through these so we're all on the same page:

1. Read the [PRP](docs/plans/ax-prp.md) for our design philosophy (the "why")
2. Read the [architecture doc](docs/plans/ax-architecture-doc.md) for implementation details (the "how")
3. Read the [security spec](docs/plans/ax-security-hardening-spec.md) for security requirements (the "or else")
4. All provider paths use flat naming: `src/providers/llm-anthropic.ts` — no subdirectories
5. All file path construction must use `safePath()` from `src/utils/safe-path.ts` — no raw `path.join()` with untrusted input
6. All IPC actions must have Zod schemas with `.strict()` mode — no unknown fields sneaking through
