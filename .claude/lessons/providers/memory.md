### pi-agent-core only supports text — image blocks must bypass it
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Context:** Debugging why Slack image attachments weren't visible to the LLM despite being downloaded and stored correctly.
**Lesson:** pi-agent-core (`@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`) only handles text user messages. When the user message includes non-text content blocks (images), they must be extracted before entering pi-agent-core and injected into the IPC/LLM call messages separately. The injection point is in `createIPCStreamFn()` after `convertPiMessages()` runs — find the last user message with string content (the prompt, not tool results) and convert it to structured content with text + image blocks.
