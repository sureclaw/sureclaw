# Workflow

### Explicit `permissions` in GitHub Actions replaces ALL defaults — always include `contents: read`
**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Context:** GitHub Pages workflow had `permissions: { pages: write, id-token: write }` but `actions/checkout` silently failed because `contents: read` was missing
**Lesson:** When setting `permissions` at the workflow or job level in GitHub Actions, you override ALL default token permissions. Only the permissions you list are granted. `actions/checkout` needs `contents: read` to clone the repo. Always include it when using explicit permissions. The checkout step may fail silently or produce cryptic errors without it.
