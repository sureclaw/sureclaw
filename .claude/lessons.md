# Lessons Learned

### safePath() treats its arguments as individual path segments, not relative paths
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** Workspace handler was producing flat filenames like `deep_nested_file.txt` instead of nested paths
**Lesson:** `safePath(base, 'deep/nested/file.txt')` treats the second arg as a single segment and replaces `/` with `_`. For relative paths from user input, split on `/` and `\` first: `safePath(base, ...relativePath.split(/[/\\]/).filter(Boolean))`. Created `safePathFromRelative()` helper for this pattern.

### Declare variables before try blocks if they're needed in finally
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** `enterpriseScratch` was declared as `const` inside a try block but referenced in the finally block for cleanup
**Lesson:** If a variable is used in both try and finally, declare it with `let` before the try block. `const` inside try is scoped to the try block and invisible to finally/catch.

### Tool count is hardcoded in multiple test files — update all of them
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** After adding 6 enterprise tools (17→23), tests failed in 5 different files that each hardcoded the expected tool count
**Lesson:** When adding new tools, search for the old count number across all test files: `grep -r 'toBe(17)' tests/` (or whatever the old count is). Files to check: tool-catalog.test.ts, ipc-tools.test.ts, mcp-server.test.ts, tool-catalog-sync.test.ts, sandbox-isolation.test.ts.

### ipcAction() auto-registers schemas in IPC_SCHEMAS — just call it at module level
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** Adding enterprise IPC schemas to ipc-schemas.ts
**Lesson:** The `ipcAction()` builder function both creates and registers Zod schemas in the `IPC_SCHEMAS` map as a side effect. Just call it at module level — no separate registration step needed. All schemas use `.strict()` mode for safety.

### Pre-existing tsc errors are expected — project uses tsx runtime
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** `npm run build` (tsc) shows 400+ errors from missing @types/node
**Lesson:** The AX project runs via tsx, not compiled tsc output. The 400+ tsc errors from missing @types/node are pre-existing and expected. Don't try to fix them — focus on vitest test results instead.
**Tags:** build, typescript, tsx, tsc

### New path helpers must handle colon-separated session IDs
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** `scratchDir()` used `validatePathSegment()` (alphanumeric/dash/underscore only), but channel session IDs like `test:thread:C02:2000.0001` contain colons and dots
**Lesson:** When adding new path functions that accept session IDs, use `isValidSessionId()` for validation and split colons into nested directories (same pattern as `workspaceDir()`). Don't use `validatePathSegment()` for session IDs — it's only for single-segment identifiers like agent names or user IDs.
**Tags:** paths, session-id, scratchDir, workspaceDir, validation

### child.killed is true after ANY kill() call, not just after the process is dead
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** `enforceTimeout` was checking `child.killed` to skip SIGKILL after SIGTERM, but `child.killed` is set to `true` the moment `kill()` is called, regardless of whether the process actually exited.
**Lesson:** Use a custom `exited` flag set via `child.on('exit', ...)` to track whether the process has actually terminated. Don't rely on `child.killed` to mean "the process is dead" — it only means "we've called kill() on it".

### Retry tests with real backoff delays need careful design
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** Channel reconnect test was timing out because it used the production retry config (2s initial delay, 5 retries) with 100 failures = 60+ seconds
**Lesson:** When testing code that uses `withRetry()` with production delay constants, either: (1) keep failure counts below max retries to avoid real timeout accumulation, (2) test the retry logic separately (already covered by retry.test.ts), or (3) make the retry options configurable and pass fast options in tests. Permanent error tests (auth errors that skip retry) are always fast and safe.

### Regex tests on source code are fragile — prefer semantic assertions
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** sandbox-isolation.test.ts used `expect(source).toMatch(/sandbox\.spawn\(\{[^}]*agentDir/s)` which broke when the spawn config was extracted into a variable.
**Lesson:** Tests that regex-match source code break whenever the code is refactored (extract variable, reorder params, etc.). Prefer simpler checks: `toContain('agentDir')` + `toMatch(/sandbox\.spawn/)` is more resilient. Even better, test behavior rather than code structure.
**Tags:** testing, regex, source-code-tests, refactoring
