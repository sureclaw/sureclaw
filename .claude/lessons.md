# Lessons Learned

### safePath() treats its arguments as individual path segments, not relative paths
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** Workspace handler was producing flat filenames like `deep_nested_file.txt` instead of nested paths
**Lesson:** `safePath(base, 'deep/nested/file.txt')` treats the second arg as a single segment and replaces `/` with `_`. For relative paths from user input, split on `/` and `\` first: `safePath(base, ...relativePath.split(/[/\\]/).filter(Boolean))`. Created `safePathFromRelative()` helper for this pattern.

### Declare variables before try blocks if they're needed in finally
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** `enterpriseScratch` was declared as `const` inside a try block but referenced in the finally block for cleanup
**Lesson:** If a variable is used in both try and finally, declare it with `let` before the try block. `const` inside try is scoped to the try block and invisible to finally/catch.

### Tool count is hardcoded in multiple test files — update all of them
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** After adding 6 enterprise tools (17→23), tests failed in 5 different files that each hardcoded the expected tool count
**Lesson:** When adding new tools, search for the old count number across all test files: `grep -r 'toBe(17)' tests/` (or whatever the old count is). Files to check: tool-catalog.test.ts, ipc-tools.test.ts, mcp-server.test.ts, tool-catalog-sync.test.ts, sandbox-isolation.test.ts.

### ipcAction() auto-registers schemas in IPC_SCHEMAS — just call it at module level
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** Adding enterprise IPC schemas to ipc-schemas.ts
**Lesson:** The `ipcAction()` builder function both creates and registers Zod schemas in the `IPC_SCHEMAS` map as a side effect. Just call it at module level — no separate registration step needed. All schemas use `.strict()` mode for safety.

### Pre-existing tsc errors are expected — project uses tsx runtime
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** `npm run build` (tsc) shows 400+ errors from missing @types/node
**Lesson:** The AX project runs via tsx, not compiled tsc output. The 400+ tsc errors from missing @types/node are pre-existing and expected. Don't try to fix them — focus on vitest test results instead.
**Tags:** build, typescript, tsx, tsc
